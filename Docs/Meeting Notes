Notes for meeting 2: (09/26/2022)

Doubts and updates: Inform Goerge about the list of requirements that we’ve made, and that we are working on a paper prototype to present with. Also ask about how to update capacities and such on accommodations. Do emergency services do it or do the glohaven agents do it?

Meeting was good. RA should have access to everything and is the one that updates and adds accommodations to the page. These accommodations will reach out to the RA and tell them they have x rooms available with all the info RA will then add in the accommodation on the site If someone wants to book a room they will call or register on the website The RA will see this and confirm the accommodation. When this happens availability should automatically reduce by how many ever rooms were booked Goerge said we can ask any doubts on the discord chat before 4 pm on weekdays And with regards to the new message by Michael on the Glohaven discord, he said no need to add anything new just yet, to just stick the functionality of supporting evacuees for now.

Duration: 35 minutes
