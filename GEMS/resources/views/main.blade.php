      <p> The Glohaven Emergency Management Solution is a digital platform which makes it easier for disaster response personnel operating in Canada to manage information and resources well during times of emergency. 
        The website we are developing for GEMS functions as a booking system, comprising of organized lists of accommodations by their locations which groups or individuals could use to find and book nearby accommodations in case they need to evacuate from their homes due to emergencies such as wildfires, flooding, etc. 
        This website will be available only to emergency services such as the police, firefighters, paramedics etc.
