Notes for meeting 2: (09/26/2022)

Doubts and updates: Inform Goerge about the list of requirements that we’ve made, and that we are working on a paper prototype to present with. Also ask about how to update capacities and such on accommodations. Do emergency services do it or do the glohaven agents do it?

Meeting was good. RA should have access to everything and is the one that updates and adds accommodations to the page.These accommodations will reach out to the RA and tell them they have x rooms available with all the infoRA will then add in the accommodation on the siteIf someone wants to book a room they will call or register on the websiteThe RA will see this and confirm the accommodation. When this happens availability should automatically reduce by how many ever rooms were bookedGoerge said we can ask any doubts on the discord chat before 4 pm on weekdaysAnd with regards to the new message by Michael on the Glohaven discord, he said no need to add anything new just yet, to just stick the functionality of supporting evacuees for now

Notes for meeting 4: (10/11/22) 

Doubts and updates:
How do admins login? User name/ employee id?
How are we hosting the website? Personal servers? Docker?
How large are the regions supposed to be? Riding districts? 

No changes in any requirements
Admins log in with username and password
No need to host the website, hosting locally and screen sharing is fine
He will get back to us with regards to how big regions should be
We can show him our presentation slides to review before presentation

Duration: 22 minutes



Notes for meeting 5: (10/17/22) 

Tips from Michael’s meeting with EMS people:
Possibility for the race condition of 2 bookings for same soon so make sure no 2 bookings can be handled at the same time. 
Multiple logins so each ra’s person must have a different login

Update for Goerge:
Everyones finished setting up Larvel. We’ve created the website and have just begun to work on it thus not much of an update just yet.

Duration: 13 minutes



Notes for meeting 5: (10/24/22) 

An RA will be assigned from the EMS department of each city/region that works with Glohaven
So an RA will themselves be an EMS person managing some city or region’s  accommodation for evacuee’s and ems
The RA of that city/region will have the rights to create new accommodations for that city/region and book accommodations for groups in that city/region
If evacuees need to make a booking they will get in contact with the RA directly or indirectly through EMS
Thinking about one access level for all RA’s no superiority yet
Someone will call ra to get stay, ra will enter booking under primary name of caller, and names  of everyone else in the group (and contact details)
RA will create their own account when its decided who the RA will be for a region/city. Also the RA does not necessarily have to be incharge of 1 city. RA's control may be over 2 cities depending on size or even a region like okanagan

Duration: 23 minutes
